# File Server

A simple file server for my personal use, written in Elixir.

## About

This was written as a personal project to host image files for [PlantID Discord Bot](https://github.com/TheRealOwenRees/plantID_discordbot), due to the changes in how Discord cache their images.

- Written in Elixir
- Web server utilises [Cowboy](https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy)
- Conversion of images to jpeg format with [Image](https://github.com/elixir-image/image)
